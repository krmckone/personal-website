I studied at the [University of Iowa](https://uiowa.edu/), receiving bachelor degrees in [Computer Science](https://cs.uiowa.edu/) and [Mathematics](https://math.uiowa.edu/). At the University, I worked part time as a math tutor in the department's [Math Tutorial Lab](https://math.uiowa.edu/math-tutorial-lab), which is something I really enjoy and has helped kindle a broader interest in mathematics at the tutorial/teaching level. I had an 8 month co-op opportunity with [Thomson Reuters](https://www.thomsonreuters.com/en.html), living and working right outside of the twin cities.

The group that I worked in is fully cloud native. Several of our people are AWS solutions architect [certified](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/) at the associate level, with a handful at the professional level.  

At that job, I learned a ton about current technologies that are relevant for business. AWS is an extremely powerful [platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) that I got to use every day at work. It was an incredible opportunity to deep dive into the platform, particularly with stories to write a ton of [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) functions in python. I do my best to not be partial towards a particular language in general, however, [Python](https://www.python.org/) is certainly one that I still find myself going to more often than not. This probably both for its powerful and expressive syntax while garnering massive support from a generous community of contributors and maintainers. These lambdas made heavy use of public APIs exposed by [SaSS providers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service). In addition, I was the driver on demonstrating the usefulness of certain SaSS providors, particularly [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/) and [DataDog](https://www.datadoghq.com/).

My current role is software engineer at the retailer [Target](https://target.com). I'm part of a team of more traditional sysadmins that utilize infrastructure as code to stand up the in-store compute infrastructure in every Target store. We primarily use [Chef](https://www.chef.io) as our configuration management tool, but are slowly transitioning to the client-less [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com).

While I have currently found myself in a more IT-centric position, this is not my passion and hope to find myself in a role where I am substantially closer to the fundamentals of code and problem solving.

One of the goals of this blog is to elaborate on what I've learned in utilizing these technologies at scale through best practices, and also how I'm using them for my own means at home at a much smaller scale. This website is hosted from [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as a static site, generated by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I automate the build and push to S3 process using [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), and I use [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) as my development environment.

The large majority of my interests, however, exist outside of the business technology realm, and I want to use this blog as another way of expressing what I'm doing in those areas. Besides programming in particular, I'd say I'm much more interested in the process of [solving problems and puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_solving).
