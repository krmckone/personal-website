I made this site as a side project to get more motivated, involved, and vocal about learning in my free time. I write a lot by hand already, but that next never makes it anywhere significant. I want to try to get my thoughts out there on the internet, and stay motivated to keep learning so I can put difficult material a more approachable format.

I'm a student at the University of Iowa, studying Computer Science and Mathematics as a double major. At the University, I work part time as a math tutor. At the time of this writing, I'm about 7 months through a co-op opportunity outside of the twin cities, working for Thomson Reuters.

The group that I've been working in is fully cloud native. Several of our people are AWS solutions architect certified at the associate level, with a handful at the professional level.  

I've learned a ton since moving to Minnesota on my own in January of 2018. AWS is an extremely powerful platform that I use every day at work. I've been blessed with the opportunity to write a ton of lambda functions in python, which is definitely my favorite language today. These lambdas made heavy use of public APIs exposed by SaSS providors I've been the driver on demonstrating the usefulness of, particularly Sumo Logic and DataDog. 

One of the goals of this blog is to elaborate on what I've learned in utilizing these technologies at scale, and also how I'm using them for my own means at home. This website is hosted from S3 as a static site, generated by Jekyll.   

I have a ton of interests outside of the business technology realm too, and I want to use this blog as another way of expressing what I'm doing in those areas.

I want to discuss how I learned to live away from home from the first time on my own real adventure, away from my college and away from family. This is what it feels like to really start writing your own story, where the structure is all yours.

I also want to discuss stuff I have going on back in school, when I move back in mid August of 2018. This is only about a month away at the time of this writing. I have probably about a year and a half left, and I have some pretty strong graduate school interests. 

Finally, I hope to dicuss just what's going on in life in general and how I'm doing my best to keep stuff simple and elegant.

If this interests you at all, stay tuned and I hope you can get something out of what I write and present.
