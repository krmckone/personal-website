## Chapter 1 Notes - Getting started

Sections
: Introduction to Imperative Programming
: Compiling/Running C Code

This section serves as an introduction to the C programming language and imperative programming. If you don't have any programming experience, then the things presented in this section might be overwhelming. If you have programming experience, this section might be too little information.

Regardless: ### Don't Panic
Take a break if nothing is making sense anymore or things are too challenging. Keep the fingers off the keyboard and come back with a fresh set of eyes.
