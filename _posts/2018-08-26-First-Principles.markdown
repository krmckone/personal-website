# How do you describe what first principles are?

Farnam Street gave me some really good ideas on what first principles are and how they relate to individuals on a daily basis. You can read up on their article for first principles [here](https://fs.blog/2018/04/first-principles/), and they also published their own short list of their first principles [here](https://fs.blog/principles/).


As a student of mathematics, I really appreciate their take on what a first principle is:

> A first principle is a foundational proposition or assumption that stands alone. We cannot deduce first principles from any other proposition or assumption.

Those who have recently dipped their toes into logic and/or proofs should notice how this fits nicely into what an axiom or basic definition is. Axioms or principles in mathematics are statements or propositions that will stand on their own; they are so basic, trivial, or fundamental that there is no possible way to prove or disprove them. The proof is unnecessary and the axiom stands on its own. More interesting and profound theorems, lemmas, and proofs of these things are later constructed using the axioms of the topic being studied and discussed. Thus, axioms are the first principles of the mathematical construct or topic. 


# A First Principles Approach is what this (life) is all about.

To reiterate on the above, first principles are, to me, an axiomatic approach to living your life. I think everyone, in one way or another, feels the essence of first principles without realizing what exactly those first principles are. Everyone has those base values or concepts that they will occasionally fall back on in an intuitive and automatic manner when things get rough or hard to deal with. There's something to be done though,that I think makes a major impact on problem solving and living your daily life. That thing is actually contemplating what these values are, writing them down, and giving them good descriptions of what those principles mean to you. I tried doing this, and it was not a quick or easy process. It's difficult to come up with such a list on the spot, say, sitting in your kitchen typing on your laptop when everything is fine and kosher. 

### How I decided what this list would be made of. 

First principles are most noticeable when there's choices to be made, problems to solve, losses and gains to be calculated. Dealing with major changes that turn you on your head also stand out on the spectrum. So, I gave myself about two to three weeks and let life occur, hoping that would give me enough data and experience to come up with a handful of points that I could potentially base my first principles off of. Here's what I came up with after that time.



## 1. Fail fast, fail early. Elegant failures are not always possible.

People could be a lot more interesting than what they give themselves credit for. I hear a lot of "I'm not smart enough" or "I'm not tough enough" in daily talks of what everyone has going on or what they wish they could accomplish/take on. I think people, as they get older, start to think that they were born with an inherent set of traits and skills and only those things will be present after they gain maturity and adulthood; they think they're locked into some field of study or some sort of field of thought, a school of existence that they naturally fall into. This school is built by themselves, by their own hands, without them even realizing it. It's not a bad looking building, and it certainly will stand the test of time. But that school only has one or two windows, and it doesn't have any fire escapes. 

It's true, failing sucks and failing loudly is even worse. People don't like other people to know about their failures and that's me included. But the fact of the matter is that you will never get outside of the perspective that your one or two windows give when you don't let yourself try new stuff and meet people different than you. I was not "naturally gifted" in mathematics or programming. I got something around a B- in high school pre-calculus. I had to retake the class in college before going onto calculus 1. These things take practice, which takes time, and requires failure. 

Failing early means that you don't hesitate; that's all there is to it. You don't say "Nah I don't want to do this because I might fail." You might not even say anything; you just try and when you fail you should be thankful that you failed before anyone else. You're already so far ahead of the game, especially in college courses. When you fail early, you learn early. You can learn earlier than anyone else, when you just fail early. 

A concrete example of this is when you're reading a textbook chapter for class on Sunday when the reading is due Wednesday. Chances are, not everything is going to make sense the first passover. That's it: you've failed early. Put it down for a few minutes, and try again, but slower this time. You can gauge the difficulty of the material well by trying the reading early and keeping the stress off. I feel that a lot of students don't even want to attempt readings because they feel like they won't ever get the material. They assume that if they can't get it the first time, they never will. Books are books because they can be read over and over again, and instructors are teachers because you can ask them questions when things still don't make sense. Fail early every time, and you'll stay head of the game. 

Failing fast plays in well with failing early. When you fail fast, you're keeping the momentum up even when you feel like you aren't meeting your own expectations or things aren't making sense as fast as you would like them to. You can make adjustments because you're getting yourself constant feedback on your readings and your understanding of the material. I like fast paced study sessions with several passovers of the material. When things aren't going to make sense to me, I want it to be as obvious and quick of an indication as possible. When I can fail fast, and that pace is accomplished early, I can ask questions in class or in office hours before the more stressful time interval of studying for several exams at once.

It has to be noted still, that failing fast and early is not always going to look good to yourself if you're not used to it. Some misunderstandings of material or incorrect solutions to practice problems are sometimes a hit on the ego of a student; I know that feeling really well especially if the subject is one of your favorites. However, the only person that should know these failures in particular is yourself and the person who will reap the most out of the first successes and the excellent performances on later exams will be yourself.



## 2. Knowledge for the sake of knowledge will always be the most profound.

Students have to do readings and they have to do assignments and they have to take exams; it's the easiest way to convey materials and check understanding. I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with this, but I do think there's some better ways students could be approaching the way they take on readings, assignments, and exams.

This structure naturally builds a lot of extrinsic motivation in students in regards to the desire to get good grades and everything that follows directly from that. So instead of reading the text book for the sake of understanding the material directly, there is a motivation to read the textbook for the sake of understanding for the sake of doing well on the exam. Again, this is not a terrible thing in itself, but it causes students to more or less disregard the knowledge and its implications outside of its applications to the course at hand. I think this happens because the desire to understand the material resides under the abstraction layer represented by the knowledge that there will be an exam worth 25 percent of the course grade.

I've done decently enough in courses with the approach that I should learn things because it will be on the exam, but I've also learned plenty of things at a high pace without there being an exam at the end of the work. I taught myself the Scheme programming language and the fundamentals of functional programming in my free time at my last internship. We never used Scheme at my job, and all of my programming was done in object oriented languages. However, I feel that there was a lot more passion and ingenuity in that time I was learning Scheme for the sake of Scheme than when I was learning Python for the sake of the assignments and the exams.

I think it's important to keep the course structure and schedule in mind, but your study schedule should much more reflect the demeanor of a focused, curious student and knowledge seeker rather than one simply attempting to get the base level knowledge required to not fail exams.



## 3. Timelessness over everything.

Trends are just that. Remember those commercials, selling cool looking stuff like the slap-chop and mighty putty? Ok, that stuff might have actually been kind of useful. But they aren't timeless like a chef's knife or a bottle of the appropriate glue.

Suspenders might not be in style anymore, but they sure do keep your pants pulled up and have that sort of aesthetic that's hard to miss.

Functionality with aesthetics is timeless. Jeans have lasted so long because they look decently enough and tend to be pretty tough and durable.

My 2001 Red Chevy Blazer is still worth driving because the engine turns on when I turn the key and doesn't look like a rusted hull yet.

Camping is a fun activity because it's the optimization problem of finding the most effective and numerous uses of the few items you can bring. That problem never has a true and unique solution, and that makes camping timeless. Fishing can be looked at the same way.

Minimalism is timeless. People have survived their entire lives with very few things. They didn't have a whole lot of free spending money to buy several cars, lots of fancy phones, and clothes. You can build a very nice aesthetic with few things that will not be hard to maintain.

The most timeless solutions and the ones that you can find people still talking about today, such as Euclid's algorithm or Pythagoras's Theorem, are also the most elegant. Even solutions to complex problems tend to have a simple abstraction that can be pulled from concrete examples.

Good abstractions are timeless and tend to appear in nature.
